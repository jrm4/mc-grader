Quick and dirty multiple choice grader; answer key needs to be UNnumbered, test number lines need to correspond to questions. Note that it uses substring matching to determine the correct answer, so it is VERY easily abused. But the output gives you everything at a glance, so this is still relatively useable as long as you at least manually look over each test.
